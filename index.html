        <p>Hello! My name is Cassandra Risner and I am from Orlando, Florida. I love spending time at the beach, soaking up the sun. I also enjoy reading books, watching movies, and cooking for my family. I was born and raised in Orlando, so I can't imaging living anywhere else. I love to visit other parts of Florida, and sometimes venture out of the state. We have so many wonderful things to do in Florida, I don't have many reasons to leave.
          I have experienced more hurricanes than snow in my life, and I am okay with that. I enjoy the afternoon thunderstorms that come in the summer, as it gives the perfect opportunity to take a nap. I also enjoy watching the heat rise from the ground and make the water evaporate immediately afterwards.
          I have one child, a son that is 26-years old. He is currently serving in the Air Force, and I am very proud of him. He is studying to work in the IT field, which is also the field in which I work. We get to discuss what we are learning in work and school, without him sharing the top secret information, of course.
